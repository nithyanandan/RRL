From e974045 (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrlphysics.py,

(*) Add function doppler_broadened_FWHM() along with docstring to
compute Doppler broadened FWHM of spectral profile of an RRL

From dfa7b3d (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrphysics.py,

(*) Add function optical_depth() along with docstring

From 0c71e30 (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrphysics.py,

(*) Update functions line_absorption_coefficient() and
line_opacity_coefficient() to use input non_lte_parms to handle
non-LTE conditions. Update docstring accordingly

From 11af818 (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrlphysics.py,

(*) Add input departure_coeff to handle departures from LTE in
functions number_density_with_energy_level() and
saha_boltzmann_equation(). Update docstrings accordingly

From dbe576c (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrlphysics.py,

(*) Add functions line_absorption_coefficient() and
line_opacity_coefficient() along with docstring to esimate line
absorption coefficient (also known as line opacity coefficient)

From 848dd3b (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrphysics.py,

(*) Fix bugs in computing Einstein B-coefficients in functions
einstein_B_lu_coeff() and einstein_B_ul_coeff()

From 3cdef78 (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrlines.py,

(*) Import astropy.units
(*) Update function search_transitions_in_freq_range() to return
frequencies in range as an instance of class astropy.units.Quantity.
Update docstring accordingly

From 6b87fe4 (master):
=====================

(*) Add rrl/rrphysics.py to git repository

(*) Add some atomic data under rrl/data/ to git repository

In rrl/rrphysics.py,

(*) Add functions bohr_radius(), statistical_weight(),
oscillator_strength(), classical_Einstein_A_coeff(),
einstein_A_coeff(), einstein_B_ul_coeff(), einstein_B_lu_coeff(),
doppler_broadened_rrline_profile(), saha_boltzmann_equation(),
and number_density_with_energy_level() along with docstrings

In rrl/rrlines.py,

(*) Minor changes

In setup.py,

(*) Include package data files now added in rrl/data/

From 6030e3a (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrlines.py,

(*) Add docstring to functions restframe_freq_recomb(),
redshifted_freq_recomb(), check_recomb_transitions_in_freq_range()
and search_transitions_in_freq_range()

From 34d2d85 (master):
=====================

(*) Add rrl/rrlines.py to repository

In rrl/rrlines.py,

(*) Add functions restframe_freq_recomb(), redshifted_freq_recomb(),
check_recomb_transitions_in_freq_range(),
search_transitions_in_freq_range() but are currently without
docstrings
