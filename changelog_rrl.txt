line_opacity_coefficient() along with docstring to esimate line
absorption coefficient (also known as line opacity coefficient)

From 848dd3b (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrphysics.py,

(*) Fix bugs in computing Einstein B-coefficients in functions
einstein_B_lu_coeff() and einstein_B_ul_coeff()

From 3cdef78 (master):
=====================

In rrl/rrlines.py,

In rrl/rrlines.py,

(*) Add functions restframe_freq_recomb(), redshifted_freq_recomb(),
check_recomb_transitions_in_freq_range(),
search_transitions_in_freq_range() but are currently without
docstrings
